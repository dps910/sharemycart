tl;dr: Let's build an app for collaborative neigbourhood groceries shopping.

## Motivation

Isolation is key to not spreading the virus. Whether it's because we're locked down, because we feel sick or because we simply put ourselves in a home-quarantine: We need to reduce public movement.

Buying groceries is something we all need to do from time to time.
I'll be out probably on Friday. I'll make a shopping list, I'll order it so that I spend as few time as possible in-store, I'll buy only necessary stuff, not more than I need for my family for the week.
It would be easy for me to add another item for my neighbours if I only knew they also need the same stuff - and it would enable them to stay home.

It's really a simple process which is a (small) solution to a universal problem worldwide.

## Implementation

I'm thinking of implementing this in JAM-stack with OpenFaaS Backend.
I'll probably pick `node-express` since it's easiest to contribute to.
