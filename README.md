# Bring-it-along

> Everybody not willing to even think about Corona / Sars-Cov-2 / Covid 19. Should skip this project. Everybody willing to contribute software to help might want to continue reading.

tl;dr: Let's build an app for collaborative neigbourhood groceries shopping.

## Motivation

Isolation is key to not spreading the virus. Whether it's because we're locked down, because we feel sick or because we simply put ourselves in a home-quarantine: We need to reduce public movement.

Buying groceries is something we all need to do from time to time.
I'll be out probably on Friday. I'll make a shopping list, I'll order it so that I spend as few time as possible in-store, I'll buy only necessary stuff, not more than I need for my family for the week.
It would be easy for me to add another item for my neighbours if I only knew they also need the same stuff - and it would enable them to stay home.

It's really a simple process which is a (small) solution to a universal problem worldwide.

## Implementation

Thee are sketches with respect to [ui](./src/ui/Readme.md) and [backend technology](./src/backend/Readme.md).

## Current state

This project is in a very early stage. It's 2020, March 18 and Sars-Cov-2 is spreading like crazy in Europe.
Though it sounds a bit miniscule (and maybe even rediculous compared to other initiatives like [3D-printing respirator valves for those already fighting death](https://www.fastcompany.com/90477940/these-good-samaritans-with-a-3d-printer-are-saving-lives-by-making-new-respirator-valves-for-free), but it's something -- And it's something I can do.
